        <p>EASSy runs from Mtunzini in <b>South Africa<b> to Port Sudan in Sudan, with landing points in nine countries and is connected to at least ten landlocked countries â€” which will no longer have to rely on satellite Internet access to carry voice and data services.<br>
EASSy was the highest capacity system serving sub-Saharan<i> Africa</i> until the commissioning of WACS. It has a 2 fibre-pair configuration with a design capacity of more than 10 terabit per second (Tbit/s).[1] It is the first to deliver direct connectivity between east Africa and Europe / North America. It is the only system with built-in resilience end-to-end. EASSy interconnects with multiple international submarine cable networks for onward connectivity to Europe, the Americas, the Middle East and Asia.<br>
The project, partially funded by the World Bank, was initiated on <del>January</del><ins>March</ins> <mark>2003</mark>, when a handful of companies investigated its feasibility. The cable entered service on 16 July 2010,[2] with commercial service starting on 30 July 2010.[3]
