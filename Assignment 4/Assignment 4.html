            <p>Harihar Fort, situated in the Sahyadri range, is one of the famous forts in Nashik district. This fort is very famous for tourism. Breaking from easy to medium range for climbing, this fort is definitely a great option for trekking.Harihargad is known for its steep steps. It is seen that these steep steps have been made by climbing the hill to climb the fort. The steps seem to be exquisite and very thoughtful. Each step has an angle of 60 degrees.
      
     
            <p> If you look at the end of the fort from the base, these steps seem to reach the sky at 80 degrees. Square notches appear on both sides of each step. While on the lower step, the hand meets the support in the groove of the upper step.
      
            <p>These notches make climbing much easier. It is only when you start climbing the fort that you realize that it would have been very difficult to climb the fort without these steps. The practice of carving forts in this manner has been going on since the Satvahana dynasty. Today, some 350 years later, some of the steps are still intact. This gives an idea of the traditional construction skills of the time.

            <p>  Harihargad is also known as Harshgad and is named after the village of Harshewadi located below the fort. Harihar fort should be restricted to unruly behavior. Also, the safety of tourists should be maintained. So the western forest rangers have denied entry to the fort without permission.Tourists will be able to visit the fort only after getting the permission of the forest officials. Also, everyone who comes to this place will be checked and the tourist crowd will be closely controlled.  

            <p>  Harihar fort was built during the Pankaj period. After that, it was in the possession of the Nizam Shah of Ahmednagar. In 1636, Shahaji Raja conquered the fort along with neighboring Trimbakgad. Later its control passed to the Mughals.Later in 1670, Moropant Pingale conquered the fort and added value to the Swarajya. Mughal Sardar Matabbar Khan conquered Harihar Gad on 8 January 1689. Finally, in 1818, the fort was captured by the British from the Marathas.
